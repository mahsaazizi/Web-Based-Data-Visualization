# City Explorer
 

## Description

A multidimensional explorer of city data from Statistics Canada.\
The polylines display cities of Canada and vertical lines represent various factors of each city.\
Factors on the x-axis are arranged from left to right with those closer to the left deemed to be specifically
important for the enterprising user group while those farther to the right are factors arbitrarily selected to
be more significant for families and newcomers whose goal is to primarily move into a community with high
quality of living. Factors in the middle portion are vital variables both user groups consider when moving to
a new community.
